  title: Jira Cloud API Get contents metadata for an expanded attachment
  description: "Returns the metadata for the contents of an attachment, if it is an
    archive. For example, if the attachment is a ZIP archive, then information about
    the files in the archive is returned. Currently, only the ZIP archive format is
    supported.  \n  \nUse this method if you are processing the data without presenting
    it in the UI, as this method only returns the metadata for the contents of the
    attachment. Otherwise, to retrieve data to present in the UI, use [Get all metadata
    for an expanded attachment](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#api-api-2-attachment-id-expand-human-get)
    which also returns the metadata for the attachment itself, such as the attachment's
    ID and name.  \n  \n**[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/FQiiLQ)
    required:** None, however the calling user must have permission to view the issue
    that the attachment belongs to."
